# Diabetes_Classification
The project includes a set of algorithms which are used to classify type II diabetes. 
The algorithms can be executed from the main method of each class. Each class has method that can be used to update algorithm parameters
Each class requires the Observation class to store a set of instances

# Implemented_Algorithms

The following algorithms were implemented: 

1.	Logistic Regression with n-restarts
2.	Multi Layer-Perceptron (MLP-BPX Network )
3.	Centroid-based KNN (CKNN)
4.	Cross Validated Enhanced K-Means (CVE-K-Means)
5.	Standard K-Means clustering
6.	Hybrid of CVE-K-Means and the Generalized Regression Neural Network (KGRNN)
7.	Hybrid of Adaboost, CVE-K-Means, and KGRNN (B-KGRNN)
